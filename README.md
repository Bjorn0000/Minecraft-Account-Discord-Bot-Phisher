## What Does It Do?
A Minecraft phishing Discord bot is a malicious program designed to deceive players and steal their personal information. To initiate the phishing process, the bot requests the user's email and Minecraft username. It claims that this information is required for verification purposes or to provide the promised rewards or access to a server.

Once the user provides their email and username, the bot will send their email which you will then go to the Microsoft prompt to log in. Because you donâ€™t have the password, you will want to click "other ways to sign in" and then receive a code at whatever email they have saved. Upon entering the verification code into the bot, it grants you access to their Minecraft/Microsoft account.
